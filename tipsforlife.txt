relation between non star and star through inverses

The shortest distance between two points on a line in a star. 
Pick a point, draw two lines from that point to the lines furthest away from that point. Also draw a line between the two points closest to that point. The intersections between these three lines will make two points. We calculate the distance between those.
For stars with an even number of n points: distance = tan(pi/2n) * sin(pi/n) * 2 * sin(pi/n)
For stars with an odd number of n points: distance = tan(pi/n) * 4 * sin(pi/n) * sin(pi/n)
